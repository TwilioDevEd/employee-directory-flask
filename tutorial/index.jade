      ## Employee Directory

      Learn how to implement an employee directory that you can query using SMS.
      Request information from anyone at your company just by sending a text message
      to a [Twilio Number](//www.twilio.com/help/faq/phone-numbers)

      Here is how it works at a high level:

      - The user sends a SMS with an Employee's name to the Twilio number.
      - The user receives information for the requested Employee.

      Let's get started!

      ## Handling Twilio's SMS Request

      When your [Twilio Number](//www.twilio.com/help/faq/phone-numbers) receives
      an SMS, Twilio will make a POST request to `/directory/search` asking for [TwiML]
      instructions.

      Once the application identifies one of the 3 possible scenarios
      (single partial match, multiple partial match or no match),
      it will send a [TwiML] response to Twilio. This response will instruct Twilio
      to send an SMS [Message](//www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/sms/message)
      back to the user.

      Let's take a closer look to each one of the scenarios.

      [TwiML]: //www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml

  .step(
    data-title="Single Partial Match",
    data-file='employee_directory_flask/views.py',
    data-highlight='15-17,30-38')
    :markdown
      ## Finding a Single Partial Employee Match

      This is the simplest scenario. We'll verify that only 1 match is
      obtained. If a single match is found, a message containing this
      employee's information is built and sent to Twilio as TwiML instructions.

      If multiple matches are found we'll try to do a multiple partial match.
      That is our next possible scenario.

  .step(
    data-title="Multiple Partial Match",
    data-file='employee_directory_flask/views.py',
    data-highlight='55-64')
    :markdown
      ## Finding Multiple Partial Employee Matches

      At this point we have already tried to use the user's query as a single
      partial match. Now we'll try to get a partial match that returns more
      than one result. We'll use [Twilio
      Cookies](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/07/the-definitive-guide-to-sms-conversation-tracking.html)
      to store suggestions. The only difference here is that we use a list to
      store suggestions so that the user can reply with a number that
      references one of the suggestions in order to get all the employee's
      information. The way this information is stored will be explained on the
      next step.

      The last scenario is so simple that a step won't be created for it. If none
      of the previous scenarios occur, it means that there is no employee in the
      database that matches the user's query. In that case, a reply will be sent
      to the user explaining that their query doesn't match any of the employees
      found on the database.

    data-highlight='42,50,57')
    :markdown
      ## Storing Suggestions With Cookies

      When a user gets a partial match by searching the employee directory, we
      reply with one or more suggestions. We need to store this suggestions, so
      the next time the user sends an SMS we know this is not a query for a new
      employee, but a selection of one of the suggestions.
      
      We'll use [Twilio Cookies][Twilio Cookies] and a [Flask Session][Flask
      Sessions] to store suggestions. They will allow you to [keep track of an
      SMS conversation][Tracking Conversations] between multiple numbers and
      your Twilio powered application.

      That's it! We have just implemented employee directory using Flask.
      Now you can get your employee's information by texting a Twilio number.
